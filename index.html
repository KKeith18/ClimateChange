        <p class = "want-centered">Climate Change has long been a topic of contention among political circles as there is continuous debate as to whether or not it is a result of human activities. However, human caused or not it is undeniable that the climate is changing as global temperatures continue to rise. We have compiled data from across the United States to give you a chance to fully understand the complex array of causes and issues that may be affecting the climate. As you scroll you will see a progression of potential causes, effects and costs of the ongoing climate crisis and it is up to you to decide: Is it really our problem? </P>

          <div class = "row"> <!--First set of Vis shows with intro to story.... layout change. redo-->
            <div class = "column column-30" id = "globalchart"></div>
            <div class = "column column">
                <p>First off we need to look at one of the direct causes of climate change, Carbon Emissions. We have long heard that carbon emissions cause our global temperatures to rise. </p>
                <p>Why is that?</p>
                <p>Well Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gases, gases which absorb and radiate heat. While having a balanced level of greenhouse gases is essential keeping the Earth’s temperature at a point where life is sustainable for us, so far we have incurred more than our Earth can handle. The extra amount of greenhouse gases we have now are causing the heat to stay within the Earth’s atmosphere, in turn raising the global temperature, the phenomenon widely known as global warming.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class = "want-centered">As we can see from the graph, the level of carbon emissions globally have increased almost exponentially. This is caused by the development of humans and our never ending goals of producing more and being global superpowers. As we can see, the rise of global annual carbon emissions started after the industrial revolution. Around this time, countries around the world had found a new and more efficient method of producing goods, a way that uses more of Earth’s natural resources to speed up their development.</p>
        <h2 id = "US">What about the US?</h2>
        <p class = 'want-centered'>Well let's look more locally, Below we will explore the United States and their Carbon Emissions</p>
        <div class = "row"><!--not sure why these 2 graphs aren't centered-->
            <div class = "column" id = "US-Chart"></div>
            <div class = "column " id = "Co2-Chart"></div>              
        </div>
        <p class = "want-centered">As we can see, the United States seems to follow the same pattern as the Global chart. Before the 1860s it seemed relatively level however after that we see an almost exponential rise in carbon emissions. </p>
        <p class = "want-centered">We can blame the industrial revolution for the large increases in carbon emissions. The industrial revolution started around the late 1700s early 1800s in Britain and spread to other parts of the world that were able to have such technology. The United States being one of the countries that were able to produce the equipment to make use of the new advancements in production. The Industrial revolution leveraged many of the Earth’s natural resources in order to expand our ability to produce. In order to use these natural resources there needed to be a source of energy, the most abundant and widely used one being coal.

            <div class = " column">
                <p>As you can see, Carbon Emissions across all sectors are trending upwards and even despite slight decreases in coal production, gas and oil are both trending upwards to compnsate. Even despite changes in the major causes of Carbon emissions, there is a concerning increase in overall carbon emissions.</p>

        <p class = 'want-centered'>Let’s take a look at an interactive map.

        <p class = 'want-centered'>As you peruse the data, it is easy to see that although not every state is experiencing warming on an equivalent level, many have shown substantial increases over the last 100 years and if trends continue, will reach dangerous levels by 2100.</p>

        <p class = "want-centered">If you thought climate change only affects the global temperature you are wrong, it also affects where your tax dollars go. Below we have a chart representing the estimated costs of sea level rise by 2100. </p>

          <p>Sea level rise is directly related to climate change, as the global temperature goes up, glaciers and other bodies of ice will start melting. It may be hard to believe that melting ice can cause such an increase in government spending but it already is happening. Currently certain parts in Florida have already started implementing new gutter systems, raised sidewalks, and other countermeasures to protect the land from a rise in the sea level.</p>
          <p>Do you live in one of these states? How do you feel that one day your income might be decreased due to climate change? Is it worth implementing all these new counter measures when the root of the problem is everyone’s view of “this is not my problem” ?</p>
