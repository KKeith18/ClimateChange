        <p class = "want-centered">Climate Change has long been a topic of contention among political circles as there is continuous debate as to whether or not it is a result of human activities. However, human caused or not it is undeniable that the climate is changing as global temperatures continue to rise. We have compiled data from across the United States to give you a chance to fully understand the complex array of causes and issues that may be affecting the climate. As you scroll you will see a progression of potential causes, effects and costs of the ongoing climate crisis and it is up to you to decide: Is it really our problem? </P>
        <br>
          <div class = "row"> <!--First set of Vis shows with intro to story.... layout change. redo-->
            <div class = "column column-30" id = "globalchart"></div>
            <div class = "column column">
                <p>First off we need to look at one of the direct causes of climate change, Carbon Emissions. We have long heard that carbon emissions cause our global temperatures to rise. </p>
                <p>Why is that?</p>
                <p>Well Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gases, are gases which absorb and radiate heat. While having a balanced level of greenhouse gases is essential keeping the Earth’s temperature at a point where life is sustainable for us, so far we have incurred more than our Earth can handle. The extra amount of greenhouse gases we have now are causing the heat to stay within the Earth’s atmosphere, in turn raising the global temperature, the phenomenon widely known as global warming.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class = 'want-centered'> The graph above illustrates the rise in global CO2 outputs over the last 250 years. As you can see, since 1840, global production of greenhouse gases has increased at a near exponential rate; rising almost tenfold from around 3 billion tons a year in 1920 to upwards of 35 billion tons in 2022. If production maintains this pace, the annual production of greenhouse gasses will double from an already exorbitant level by 2060.  
        </p>
        <p class = "want-centered">As you can see, there is a slight slump in the rate from 2008 to the present. This can likely be attributed to changing attitudes towards clean energy and the development of a movement to curb carbon emissions. If we can even begin to flatten the curve further and slow the emission rate we have a chance of slowing the climate process and delaying any further changes. </p>
        <h2 id = "US">What about the US?</h2>
        <p class = 'want-centered'>Well let's look more locally, Below we will explore the United States and their Carbon Emissions</p>
        <div class = "row"><!--not sure why these 2 graphs aren't centered-->
            <div class = "column" id = "US-Chart"></div>
            <div class = "column " id = "Co2-Chart"></div>              
        </div>
        <p class = "want-centered">As of 2022, the United States is responsible for almost 1/7th of the world’s CO2 emissions, with a carbon trend directly mirroring that of the greater world. As such, it also becomes clear that the steep drop in US carbon emissions in recent years as a result of a ween from coal and other unsustainable energy methods may have a direct impact on the slow in global emissions around the same time.  </p>
        <p class = "want-centered">With such a massive share of the globe's emission rate, the United States is hugely important in the reduction of global carbon production. Looking at the per capita graph, we can see the direct impact of the individual on the national trend. Both graphs are nearly identical, with slumps and spikes being directly mirrored. Taking part in carbon cutting practices can have a direct effect on the global trend if done in large enough numbers and it is important to remember that no reduction is insignificant.  
        </p>
        <h2 id ="Stack_Chart">Co2 Emissions By Industry</h2>
        <div class = "row">

            <div class = "column" id = "EmissionsBy-Chart"></div>
            <div class = " column">
                <p>As you can see, Carbon Emissions across all sectors in the US are trending upwards. Despite recent decreases in reliance on coal as seen in the sharp drop in coal's share of total emissions beginning around 2004, industries such as gas and flaring have begun to climb in recent years. Even with the replacement of coal based energies, if we do not move towards a renewable source of energy production, new sectors of carbon production will overtake those that are on the decline, preventing any meaningful net-decreases in national CO2 emissions. </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2 id = 'Tableau_Chart'>How Have Greenhouse Gases Affected Temperature in the US?</h2>
        <p class = 'want-centered'>As a result of the increasing trends in global and national carbon emissions, greenhouse gas levels are reaching a concerning rate. With global carbon emissions continuing to rise, there has been a visible and proportional increase in average temperatures not only in the US, but across the globe. According to NASA “These heat-trapping gases can be thought of as a blanket wrapped around Earth, keeping the planet toastier than it would be without them.”</p>
        <p class = 'want-centered'>Utilizing the slider below, you can observe the nationwide increase in average annual temperatures in the United States dating back to 1895. Hovering over any state will display its average temperature in that year. States such as Colorado have seen increases as high as 3 degrees in that time, moving from an average annual temperature of 43 in 1895 to 46 in 2022. While this change may seem insignificant, according to NASA “If warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, more than 70 percent of Earth’s coastlines will see sea-level rise greater than 0.66 feet (0.2 meters), resulting in increased coastal flooding, beach erosion, salinization of water supplies and other impacts on humans and ecological systems.”</strong></p>

        <div id = 'line-chart'></div>
        <br>
        <p class = 'want-centered'>As you peruse the data, it is easy to see that although not every state is experiencing warming on an equivalent level, many have shown substantial increases over the last 100 years and if trends continue, will reach dangerous levels by 2100.</p>
        <div class = "row" id = "line-Chart"></div>
        <h2 id = 'Rise_Chart'> How have temperature changes affected the world?</h2>
        <p class = "want-centered">As NASA claims, rising temperatures in the US and across the globe of even a couple degrees can result in catastrophic changes in weather patterns, ecosystems, and sea levels. As you can see in the graphs above, the steady increase in annual temperatures over the past 100 years can be directly correlated with a steady yet alarming increase in sea levels over the same time period.  As the Earth’s average temperature increases, large glaciers and other bodies of ice start to melt, dumping massive volumes of newly thawed water into the oceans.</p>
        <div class = "row">
          <div class = "column" id = "temperature"></div>
          <div class = "column" id = "sealevel"></div>
        </div>
       
        <p class = "want-centered">From 1900, global sea levels have already risen over 8 inches and the rate at which seas are rising has only increased over the past 20 years. As a result of even a single inch in rise, coastal cities and environments are placed at increased risk of destructive flooding and eventually complete submersion if trends continue. </p>
        <h2 id = 'Cost_Chart'>Does this have any economic cost on you?</h2>
        <p class = "want-centered">If you thought climate change only affects the global temperature you are wrong, it also affects where your tax dollars go. Below we have a chart representing the estimated costs of sea level rise by 2100. </p>
        <div class = "row">
        <div class = "column" id = "cost-Chart"></div>
        <div class = "column">
          <p>As temperatures increase, ice continues to melt, and sea levels rise, the impact on coastal areas only becomes more and more costly. The graph to the left shows the projected costs of property damage as a result of coastal sea level changes by 2100. Key states such as New York, New Jersey and Florida alone represent over 550 billion dollars in damages, resulting in increases in taxes, inflated national debt, and a reduction in quality of life. It may be hard to believe that melting ice can cause such an increase in government spending but it already is happening. Currently certain parts in Florida have already started implementing new gutter systems, raised sidewalks, and other countermeasures to protect the land from a rise in the sea level.</p>
          <p>Do you live in one of these states? How do you feel that one day your income might be decreased due to climate change? Is it worth implementing all these new counter measures when the root of the problem is the prevailing view that “this is not my problem”?</p>

        </div>
        </div>
        <h2 id = 'Tableau_Chart'>So What??</h2>
        <p class = "want-centered"> While the debate still rages as to whether humanity is responsible for the ongoing climate crisis, the root of the problem remains: the ongoing climate crisis. As you now know, the trends in global carbon emissions directly correlate with temperature increases over the last 140 years which in turn correlate with rising sea levels and eventually massive economic damages. While it is still possible to argue that these correlations are not causations, is it really worth risking? If you trust the raw data, it becomes undeniable that an increase in carbon emissions has had a direct effect on every aspect of the globe's health. And it is up to you to ask once again - “Is it really my problem?” and this time, come up with an answer. </p>
