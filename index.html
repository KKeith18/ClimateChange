                <p>First off we need to look at one of the direct causes of climate change, Carbon Emissions. We have long heard that carbon emissions cause our global temperatures to rise. </p>
                <p>Why is that?</p>
                <p>Well Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gases, gases which absorb and radiate heat. While having a balanced level of greenhouse gases is essential keeping the Earth’s temperature at a point where life is sustainable for us, so far we have incurred more than our Earth can handle. The extra amount of greenhouse gases we have now are causing the heat to stay within the Earth’s atmosphere, in turn raising the global temperature, the phenomenon widely known as global warming.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class = "want-centered">As we can see from the graph, the level of carbon emissions globally have increased almost exponentially. This is caused by the development of humans and our never ending goals of producing more and being global superpowers. As we can see, the rise of global annual carbon emissions started after the industrial revolution. Around this time, countries around the world had found a new and more efficient method of producing goods, a way that uses more of Earth’s natural resources to speed up their development.</p>
        <h2 id = "US">What about the US?</h2>
        <p class = 'want-centered'>Well let's look more locally, Below we will explore the United States and their Carbon Emissions</p>
        <div class = "row"><!--not sure why these 2 graphs aren't centered-->
            <div class = "column" id = "US-Chart"></div>
            <div class = "column " id = "Co2-Chart"></div>              
        </div>
        <p class = "want-centered">As we can see, the United States seems to follow the same pattern as the Global chart. Before the 1860s it seemed relatively level however after that we see an almost exponential rise in carbon emissions. </p>
        <p class = "want-centered">We can blame the industrial revolution for the large increases in carbon emissions. The industrial revolution started around the late 1700s early 1800s in Britain and spread to other parts of the world that were able to have such technology. The United States being one of the countries that were able to produce the equipment to make use of the new advancements in production. The Industrial revolution leveraged many of the Earth’s natural resources in order to expand our ability to produce. In order to use these natural resources there needed to be a source of energy, the most abundant and widely used one being coal.
